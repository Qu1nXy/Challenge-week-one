  I'd love to represent you my first project which gave me a lot of knoledge how fix existing code and make it more readeble #scout rule#.
  
                                                        What was my motivation?

I found it really interestind , didn't sleep properly ,because all my mind was focused on the project .I tried to fix the code which 
                               in my opinion wasn't so bad .I was pleased with the final result.
                           
                                                  What problems have been solved?
                           
One of the link from the existing code didn't open ,the code was too large and there was no logic ,in principle it doesn't exist now ,
                                       but i am pleased that there are fewer components.
